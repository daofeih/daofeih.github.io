Feed the words into my brain, and then write down anything it outputs. This is the way I take notes while reading.

It means I abandoned any definite note-taking method, such as "excerpts + comments", [mind maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map), the [Cornell Notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes), [SQ3R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQ3R), and [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). No, I don't need any of them because I discovered that it was hard to force myself to insist on one of them. Freedom is the most important factor to keep me continuing to write.

I make my notes flow like a river. It doesn't need to be well-formed, friendly readable, or complete. It's a record of my personal reading experience.

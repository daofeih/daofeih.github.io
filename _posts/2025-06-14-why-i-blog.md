I love writing. I believe that writing is a good way—even the only way—to think well. I can let ideas fly through my brain, but eventually, they will be messy or disappear. Writing down will make them clear and definite, and give me a chance to reflect on them in the future.

Where do I write? On paper—an obvious answer before the computing era. However, in the 2020s, I prefer writing on a digital device. I can write in many note apps, such as [Evernote](https://evernote.com/), [Notion](https://www.notion.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and [Bear](https://bear.app/), but I like to keep the data by myself. [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is my current favorite format for writing. It's [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text); thus, it can be easily interpreted even hundreds of years later. Its grammar is super lightweight; thus, it can be learned and grasped in a few minutes. I want to make my writing public to get some reviews; thus, I publish them as a blog through a static site generator such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Blog means "web log"—a log published on the web. It emerged in the 1990s, and nowadays, it's declined. However, I don't expect to earn traffic or money through my blog. I just need a place to practice writing. So just keep writing.
